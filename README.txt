This was an assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course. I was given puzzle.py and skeleton code in the sudoku.py file, and I implemented the bfs_search(), dfs_search(), A_star_search(), calculate_total_cost(), calculate_manhattan_dist(), and test_goal() functions. The program does not display the boards as grids, but rather as 81 digits, representing each row of the grid laid end to end. I'm considering implementing graphics for practice in UI/UX.
